## Usage
PS: only tested with python3

Install dependencies with ````pip install -r requirements.txt````

Run ````python main.py````

### Commands
Input a query whenever you're prompted, or type "k" to keep a previous query.

To select a specific image to choose as your direction, input it's position from left -> right, and downwards. (ex: row 3 image 4, if there are 8 pictures on each row, means 2*8+4=20)

Or you may input "r" to get a random direction, or selected image to move towards.

By inputting an empty query (can't happen on the first call), you will move towards the filters or direction in an unconstrained matter.
